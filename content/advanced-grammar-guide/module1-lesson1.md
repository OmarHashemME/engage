## Mixed Conditionals

Standard conditionals (First, Second, Third) generally keep the time frame consistent (all past, or all present/future). **Mixed Conditionals** break this rule to describe how a **past action** affects a **present situation** (or vice versa).

### Past Action -> Present Result
This is the most common mix (Third Conditional + Second Conditional).
*   **Structure:** If + Past Perfect, ... would + Verb (base).
*   **Example:** "If I **had won** the lottery (past), I **would be** rich right now (present)."

**Contrast with Third Conditional:**
*   "If I **had won** the lottery, I **would have bought** a house." (This is all in the past).

### Present Condition -> Past Result
This describes a permanent state (present) that caused a past event.
*   **Structure:** If + Past Simple, ... would have + Past Participle.
*   **Example:** "If I **were** a good cook (general truth), I **would have made** dinner myself (past event)."

### When to use them?
Use Mixed Conditionals to show regret about the past and its impact on your life today, or to explain why something happened in the past based on a personality trait or fact that is still true today.
