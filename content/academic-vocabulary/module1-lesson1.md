## Formal Transition Words

In casual conversation, we use simple connecting words like **and**, **but**, and **so**. However, in academic writing or professional presentations, these can sound too simple. Using formal transition words helps your ideas flow logically and sounds more sophisticated.

### Contrast (Instead of "But")
*   **However**: "The data is promising; **however**, more research is needed."
*   **Nevertheless**: "It was raining; **nevertheless**, the game continued."
*   **In contrast**: "Europe is cooling down. **In contrast**, South America is heating up."

### Addition (Instead of "And")
*   **Furthermore**: "The candidate has experience. **Furthermore**, she speaks three languages."
*   **Moreover**: "This policy is expensive. **Moreover**, it is ineffective."
*   **In addition**: "We need signatures. **In addition**, we need the fee."

### Result (Instead of "So")
*   **Therefore**: "He did not study; **therefore**, he failed."
*   **Consequently**: "The market crashed; **consequently**, jobs were lost."
*   **Thus**: "Supply is low; **thus**, prices are high."

Using these words correctly will instantly make your English sound more professional.
