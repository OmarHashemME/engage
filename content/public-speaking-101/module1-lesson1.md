## Overcoming Stage Fright

Glossophobia, or the fear of public speaking, affects almost everyone—even native speakers! Speaking in a second language adds another layer of anxiety. Here is how to manage it.

### 1. Preparation is Key
Anxiety often comes from the fear of the unknown.
*   **Know your topic:** If you know what you are talking about, you will feel more secure.
*   **Practice:** Record yourself (use the Practice tab!) and listen back.

### 2. Physical Calming Techniques
*   **Deep Breathing:** Take a deep breath in for 4 counts, hold for 4, and exhale for 4. This lowers your heart rate.
*   **Power Posing:** Stand tall with your hands on your hips (like a superhero) for two minutes before you speak. It changes your body chemistry and boosts confidence.

### 3. It's Not About Perfection
The audience doesn't want you to fail; they want to hear what you have to say.
*   **Don't apologize** for your English.
*   **Slow down.** When we are nervous, we tend to speed up. Deliberately speaking slower makes you sound more confident and gives you time to think.

Remember: Confidence is not the absence of fear, but the mastery of it.
