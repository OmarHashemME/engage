## Show, Don't Tell

"Show, don't tell" is the golden rule of creative writing. It means you should allow the reader to experience the story through actions, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author’s exposition and summarization.

### The Difference

**Telling:**
> The man was nervous.

This is boring. It gives information, but no feeling.

**Showing:**
> Sweat trickled down his forehead. He tapped his foot rapidly against the floor and refused to make eye contact.

This creates a mental image. The reader **infers** that the man is nervous based on the evidence provided.

### How to "Show"

1.  **Use Sensory Details:** Describe what things look, sound, smell, taste, or feel like.
2.  **Describe Action:** Instead of saying someone is "happy," describe them "jumping for joy" or "grinning from ear to ear."
3.  **Use Dialogue:** Let characters reveal their personality through what they say.

**Practice:**
Take the sentence "It was a hot day."
*   *Show it:* "The asphalt shimmered in the distance, and the ice cream melted before it even touched the cone."
