## What are Idioms?

An idiom is a phrase or expression that has a **figurative meaning**, which is different from the literal meaning of the words. They are a colorful and creative part of the English language.

### For example:

> "It's raining cats and dogs."

This doesn't mean animals are falling from the sky! It's an idiom that means "It's raining very heavily."

You can't understand an idiom by looking up each word in the dictionary. You have to learn the meaning of the entire phrase.

### Why learn idioms?
- To understand native speakers in movies, TV shows, and real conversations.
- To sound more natural and fluent when you speak.
- To better understand English culture.
