## Listening for Gist

Have you ever listened to a native speaker and panicked because you missed one word? You probably stopped listening to the rest of the sentence while trying to figure out that one word.

This is a common mistake. To fix it, you need to practice **listening for the gist**.

### What is "The Gist"?

The gist is the **main idea** or the general meaning of what someone is saying. It answers questions like:
*   Who is talking?
*   Where are they?
*   Are they happy or angry?
*   What is the general topic (e.g., travel, food, business)?

### How to Practice

1.  **Relax:** Accept that you won't understand 100% of the words. That's okay!
2.  **Focus on Keywords:** Nouns and verbs usually carry the most meaning. If you hear "train," "late," and "sorry," you can guess the gist: The speaker is apologizing because their train was delayed.
3.  **Use Context:** Look at the speaker's body language or the situation.

Next time you watch a movie in English, try to turn off the subtitles and just ask yourself: "What is happening right now?" independent of the specific words.
