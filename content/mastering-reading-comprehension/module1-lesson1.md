## Skimming vs. Scanning

Two of the most powerful tools in a reader's toolkit are **skimming** and **scanning**. While they both involve reading quickly, they have very different purposes.

### Skimming: Getting the Gist

**Skimming** is reading rapidly to get a general overview of the material. You aren't reading every word. Instead, you are looking for the main idea.

**How to Skim:**
*   Read the **title** and headings.
*   Read the **first paragraph** (introduction).
*   Read the **first sentence** of every other paragraph.
*   Read the **last paragraph** (conclusion).

Use skimming when you want to know if an article is relevant to your interests or to preview a text before studying it in detail.

### Scanning: Hunting for Details

**Scanning** is reading rapidly to find specific facts. You usually have a specific question in mind, like "What year was the treaty signed?" or "How much does the ticket cost?"

**How to Scan:**
*   Keep your **keyword** in mind (e.g., "1999", "$50").
*   Move your eyes quickly over the lines.
*   **Ignore** everything that isn't your keyword.
*   Stop reading when you find the match.

By mastering these two techniques, you can save hours of reading time!
