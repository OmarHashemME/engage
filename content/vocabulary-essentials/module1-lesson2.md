## Unlocking Words with Prefixes

Prefixes are small word parts added to the **beginning** of a word to change its meaning. Understanding common prefixes is like having a key to unlock hundreds of new words.

### Common Prefixes

Here are a few of the most common prefixes in English:

| Prefix | Meaning      | Example      |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| `un-`  | not          | **un**happy (not happy) |
| `re-`  | again, back  | **re**do (do again)     |
| `pre-` | before       | **pre**view (view before) |
| `dis-` | not, opposite| **dis**agree (not agree) |

### Putting it into Practice

When you see a word like "**re**assemble," you can break it down:
- `re-` means "again"
- `assemble` means "put together"

So, "reassemble" means to put something together again. Simple!

Start looking for prefixes in the words you read. It's a powerful shortcut to expanding your vocabulary.
