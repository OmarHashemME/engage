## The Power of Context

Welcome to Vocabulary Essentials! In this first lesson, we'll explore the most important tool for understanding new words: **context**.

### What is Context?

Context refers to the words and sentences that surround an unfamiliar word. These surrounding clues can help you guess the meaning without having to immediately look it up in a dictionary.

Consider this sentence:

> The archaeologist carefully brushed the dust away from the fragile **artifact**.

Even if you don't know what "artifact" means, the context gives you clues:
- It was found by an **archaeologist**.
- It's **fragile** and covered in dust.

From this, you can infer that an artifact is likely an old object of historical interest.

### Why Use Context?

*   **It's faster:** You don't have to stop reading to look up every word.
*   **It improves comprehension:** Understanding how a word is used helps you remember it better.
*   **It's a natural skill:** It's how native speakers learn most of their vocabulary!

Try to use context clues the next time you encounter a new word. You'll be surprised how often you can figure out the meaning on your own!
