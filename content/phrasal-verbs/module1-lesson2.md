## Separable vs. Inseparable

One tricky thing about phrasal verbs is that some are **separable**, while others are **inseparable**.

### Separable Phrasal Verbs

With a separable phrasal verb, you can put the object **between** the verb and the preposition/adverb.

**Example: `turn down`** (to refuse an offer)

- I had to **turn down** the job offer. (Object is after)
- I had to **turn** the job offer **down**. (Object is in the middle)

> **Important Rule:** If the object is a pronoun (like `it`, `them`, `me`), it **must** go in the middle.
> - Correct: I had to turn **it** down.
> - Incorrect: I had to turn down **it**.

### Inseparable Phrasal Verbs

With an inseparable phrasal verb, the object must always come **after** the full phrase. You cannot separate the verb from its particle.

**Example: `look after`** (to take care of)

- I will **look after** your dog.
- Incorrect: I will look your dog after.

There's no simple rule to know which is which; you have to learn them as you encounter them.
