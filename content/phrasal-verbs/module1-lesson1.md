## What is a Phrasal Verb?

Phrasal verbs are very common in English, especially in informal conversation. They are phrases that combine a **verb** with a **preposition** or **adverb** (or both). The meaning of the phrasal verb is often very different from the meaning of the individual words.

### Verb + Preposition

Think of the verb **"look"**.
- `look for` means to search for something. (e.g., "I'm looking for my keys.")
- `look after` means to take care of someone or something. (e.g., "Can you look after my cat?")
- `look up to` means to admire someone. (e.g., "I really look up to my teacher.")

As you can see, the meaning changes completely when you add the preposition!

### Why They Are Tricky

The main challenge is that you often can't guess the meaning from the parts. You need to learn them as you would learn any other new vocabulary word. The best way to learn them is through context and practice.
